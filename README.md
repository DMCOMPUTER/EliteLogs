> ‚ú® **EliteLogs** ‚Äî a Minecraft plugin built for server admins who are done with messy, unreadable logs.  
> It neatly records everything that matters: player activity, system events, errors, and warnings.  
> With structured folders and per-player logs, you‚Äôll always know where to look when chaos strikes.

- Global daily logs (`logs/<module>/global-YYYY-MM-DD.log`) for quick server-wide insights.
- Configurable modules ‚Äî enable or disable exactly what you need via `config.yml`.
- Session reports for both server and players, stored separately for better tracking.
